# Task 3: IoT Security System

## Objective
To build an IoT-based security system that detects
motion and sends alerts.

## Description
This project uses a PIR motion sensor to detect
movement. When motion is detected, an alert is
generated and sent to the user.

## Features
- Motion detection
- Alert system
- Real-time response

## Working
- PIR sensor detects motion
- Arduino processes data
- Alert sent to mobile application

## Conclusion
This IoT security system helps in monitoring and
protecting environments using smart technology.
